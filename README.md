# Meals App
Capstone app made during Flutter Bootcamp @ GDG Lisbon.

This app intends to be a cooking book with recipes all over the world.
Is is possible to look for recipes either by country of origin or type of meal.

In the recipes page, you can find a picture, ingredient list, intructions and a link in the bottom to the youtube video.

Right now we'are using a public API , [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) , which is a free database with recipes from around the world.
